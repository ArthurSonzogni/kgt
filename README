 Output: Various BNF-like syntaxes, AST dumps, and Railroad Syntax Diagrams


To build and install:

 ; pmake -r install

You can override a few things:

 ; CC=clang PREFIX=$HOME pmake -r install

Building depends on:

 * Any BSD make. This includes OpenBSD, FreeBSD and NetBSD make(1)
   and sjg's portable bmake (also packaged as pmake).

 * A C compiler. Any should do, but GCC and clang are best supported.

 * ar, ld, and a bunch of other stuff you probably already have.
